# Forest-Fire-Prediction

Welcome to the Forest Fire Prediction project! This repository contains the complete code and analysis for predicting forest fires using the Algerian Forest Fires dataset. The project leverages powerful data processing, visualization, and machine learning techniques to achieve an impressive 98% accuracy in forecasting forest fire incidents.

üöÄ Project Overview
This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to building a forest fire prediction model. The key steps include:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

Handling missing values and inconsistent data.

Converting data types and normalizing features.

Feature selection using correlation analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizing data distributions and relationships using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

Generating insightful heatmaps, boxplots, and histograms.

Model Development:

Implementing Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge Regression models.

Splitting the data into training and testing sets.

Feature scaling with StandardScaler for robust model evaluation.

Evaluation & Results:

Evaluating model performance using the R¬≤ score.

Achieving a high prediction accuracy of 98%.

Visualizing predictions with scatter plots to compare true vs. predicted values.

üí° Features
Data Cleaning: Automated handling of missing values and outliers.

Visualization: Detailed EDA with clear, informative charts.

Feature Engineering: Identification and removal of highly correlated features.

Model Training: Multiple regression models to identify the best performing one.

Evaluation: Comprehensive evaluation metrics to validate model performance.

üìä Usage
Data Preparation:
Run the provided Python scripts or Jupyter Notebooks to perform data cleaning and preprocessing on the Algerian Forest Fires dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis:
Visualize the dataset using Seaborn and Matplotlib to understand key features and their correlations.

Model Training and Evaluation:
Train the machine learning models (Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge) and evaluate their performance using train-test split and feature scaling.

Visualization of Results:
